# Steam Games Insight Engine - Development Log

## Project Overview
Building a unified pipeline to analyze Steam game reviews, combining web scraping, credibility detection, aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), and emotion classification.

## Date: January 2025

### Initial Analysis & Design Decisions

#### 1. **Project Structure Analysis**
- Examined existing modules: B (Web Scraping), C (Credibility Detection), D (ABSA), E (Emotion Analysis)
- Decided to create a modular pipeline that runs B→C→D→E sequentially
- Each module will have a wrapper to standardize inputs/outputs

#### 2. **Key Requirements Identified**
- **Input flexibility**: Accept both Steam game ID and game name
- **Minimum reviews**: 1000 reviews (500 absolute minimum)
- **Language**: English-only enforcement
- **GPU**: Assume GPU available, no fallbacks needed
- **Output**: All visualizations saved in subfolders
- **Error handling**: Log errors and continue with partial results

### Module Development

#### 3. **Credibility Detection Enhancement**
**Decision Process:**
- Analyzed 6 different rule sets (y1-y6) with fake rates from 0.23% to 14.80%
- Initially considered y4 (6.95%) as "middle ground"
- After deeper analysis, selected **y3 (2.92%)** because:
  - Catches obvious fake patterns without being overly aggressive
  - Includes unique "controversy manipulation" detection
  - Better balance between false positives and false negatives
  - More reasonable thresholds (e.g., 50 reviews vs 100)

**Enhancements Added:**
1. **Time-based patterns**: Detects rapid-fire reviews (< 5 minutes apart)
2. **Review velocity**: Flags users posting > 5 reviews/day
3. **Engagement ratio**: Identifies prolific reviewers with < 10% engagement

**KNN Integration:**
- Kept KNN as second layer of detection
- Uses 7 features in normalized space
- k=7 based on notebook validation
- OR operation: review flagged if rules OR KNN flag it

#### 4. **Game Lookup Module**
**Features Implemented:**
- Web scraping Steam search (no API key needed)
- Dual input support:
  - Direct game ID validation
  - Game name search with results
- Interactive selection mode
- Returns: ID, name, release date, price

**Technical Choices:**
- BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
- Regex for ID extraction from URLs
- User-Agent header to avoid blocking

#### 5. **Data Cleaning Module**
**Cleaning Steps:**
- Remove empty reviews
- Parse timestamps to datetime
- Ensure numeric columns are numeric
- Add calculated fields:
  - review_length
  - review_words
  - pseudo author_id (for pattern detection)
- Validate ranges (playtime ≥ 0, vote score 0-1)

**Summary Statistics:**
- Total reviews, average/median playtime
- Review length metrics
- Date range coverage
- Steam purchase verification

```

#### Clean Overwrite System
**Problem Solved**: Re-running analysis on same game created timestamp spam
**Solution**: Clean file names with optional backup
- `analysis_results.json` (not `2358720_analysis_20250602_180532.json`)
- `credible_reviews.csv` (not `2358720_credible_20250602_180532.csv`)
- Predictable visualization names
- User-configurable backup of previous runs

#### Enhanced Validation
- **Hard requirement**: 1000 reviews minimum (blocks analysis)
- **Soft warning**: ≤2500 reviews (recommends more)
- **Fake rate monitoring**: Warns when >10% flagged as fake
- **Post-filtering validation**: Alerts if too few credible reviews remain

#### Data Cleanup
- **Wiped all existing data**: Clean slate for testing new system
- **Preserved**: Code, models, documentation, configuration
- **Ready**: For fresh multi-game analysis with clean structure

### Recent Updates (January 6, 2025 - Morning)

#### Notebook & Pipeline Fixes
- **Fixed notebook structure**: Removed misplaced Step 6 markdown after Step 2
- **Fixed import issues**: WebScraping module now imports correctly with proper path handling
- **Fixed dependencies**: Added auto-install for missing packages like tf-keras
- **Made self-contained**: Copied all necessary files from E module to Final Pipeline
  - simple_predict.py, trainers/, configs/ all now in pipeline_utils
  - No more external dependencies on E module

#### Visualization Improvements
1. **ABSA Heatmap Fix**:
   - Only "Positive %" row uses color scale (RdYlGn)
   - Confidence % and Mentions rows are neutral gray
   - Fixed issue where 80% positive showed as red (now properly green)
   - Better text contrast (white on dark colors, black on light)

2. **ABSA Stacked Bars Enhancement**:
   - Automatic log scale detection for large value ranges (>100x difference)
   - Better label positioning for both linear and log scales
   - Shows both percentages and absolute counts
   - Added grid for better readability
   - Handles extreme value distributions gracefully

3. **Emotion Distribution Improvements**:
   - Handles extreme dominance (e.g., 76.5% joy) by grouping smaller emotions as "Others"
   - Shows both percentages and absolute counts in pie chart
   - Better visibility for small emotion categories
   - More informative titles with total counts

4. **ABSA Pie Chart Enhancement**:
   - Custom formatting showing both percentages and absolute counts
   - Better text readability with white bold text
   - Total analyzed reviews in title

5. **Added Entropy Analysis**:
   - 4-panel visualization for uncertainty analysis
   - Normalized entropy (0-1 scale)
   - Shows entropy distribution, by emotion, boxplots, and vs confidence
   - Currently uses entropy = 1 - confidence (placeholder for true Shannon entropy)
   - Added documentation about true Shannon entropy calculation

6. **Color Consistency**:
   - Green = positive sentiment
   - Red = negative sentiment
   - Gray = neutral/informational metrics

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Progress Tracking**: Using tqdm for all long operations
- **Visualization Format**: PNG at 300 DPI for quality
- **Report Format**: Plain text for compatibility
- **Error Strategy**: Log and continue vs. fail fast
- **Module Independence**: Each can run standalone if needed
- **Self-contained Pipeline**: All dependencies in Final Pipeline folder
- **Entropy Analysis**: Normalized entropy (0-1) for uncertainty measurement
- **Color Schemes**: Fixed confusing red/green usage in visualizations
- **Minimum Reviews**: 1000 (consistent throughout)

### Key Insights & Learnings
- Credibility detection is nuanced - too strict removes legitimate reviews
- Combining multiple ABSA approaches provides better coverage
- Steam's web interface is scrapeable without API keys
- Pseudo author IDs help pattern detection when real IDs unavailable
- KNN adds modest improvement to rule-based detection
- **NEW**: Wrapper pattern preserves original code while adding features
- **NEW**: State management crucial for long pipelines
- **NEW**: Text reports complement visualizations for detailed analysis
- **NEW**: Confidence ≠ 1 - entropy (better uncertainty measures exist)
- **NEW**: Color choices matter - 80% positive shouldn't be red!
- **NEW**: Bimodal confidence distribution suggests model uncertainty issues

### Questions Resolved
- ✅ Which credibility threshold? → y3 with enhancements
- ✅ Which ABSA module? → Both
- ✅ How to handle game search? → Web scraping
- ✅ Model download strategy? → Setup script
- ✅ Output format? → Visualizations in subfolders
- ✅ How to connect modules? → Shared DataFrame schema
- ✅ Error handling? → Log and continue
- ✅ Confidence calculation? → Max probability (but entropy is better)
- ✅ Visualization colors? → Fixed to be intuitive
- ✅ Pipeline dependencies? → All self-contained in Final Pipeline

### ABSA Methodology Overhaul (January 6, 2025 - Final)

#### Problem Identified: Conflicting ABSA Approaches
**Issue**: Current pipeline used hardcoded aspect keywords copied from "Faster ABSA" approach, defeating the purpose of data-driven aspect discovery.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- **Original "Faster ABSA"** (D. Faster ABSA_Script.py): Hardcoded 8 aspects with fixed keywords
- **Original "Guided NMF"** (D. Guided NMF and ABSA.ipynb): Data-driven discovery using NMF + seed words
- **Current Pipeline**: Incorrectly combined both - took hardcoded keywords but added more aspects

#### Solution Implemented: Guided NMF with Universal Gaming Seeds

**New Methodology**:
1. **Universal Gaming Seed Words**: Genre-agnostic seeds that work across all game types
   - `gameplay`, `graphics`, `performance`, `content`, `audio`, `value`
2. **Guided NMF Discovery**: Seeds guide algorithm but actual keywords discovered from each game's data
3. **Data-Driven Accuracy**: Keywords specific to each game's review vocabulary
4. **Consistent Aspects**: Same aspect categories across all games for comparability

**Key Benefits**:
- ✅ **Accuracy**: Keywords discovered from actual review data
- ✅ **Consistency**: Same aspect framework for all games  
- ✅ **Interpretability**: Meaningful aspect labels (not "Topic 0", "Topic 1")
- ✅ **Scalability**: Works across different game genres

**Technical Implementation**:
- Added `discover_aspects_nmf()` method using sklearn TF-IDF + NMF
- Universal seed words guide discovery without hardcoding final keywords
- Fallback to seed words if NMF fails (sklearn not available)
- Comprehensive logging of discovered keywords per aspect

**Future Development Noted**:
- Genre-specific seed words (RPG vs FPS vs Strategy)
- Configurable seed words per analysis
- Hybrid approach with both guided and pure unsupervised topics

### Self-Containment Achieved (January 6, 2025 - Final)

#### Complete External Dependency Removal
- **WebScraping Module**: Copied `B. WebScraping.py` to `src/pipeline_utils/web_scraping.py`
- **Web Scraper Wrapper**: Updated to use local `web_scraping` module instead of external import
- **Notebook Cell 4**: Removed parent directory WebScraping import, now uses local `WebScraperWrapper`
- **Notebook Cell 6**: Updated model setup to use local `models/` directory instead of external E module
- **Main Pipeline**: Removed `sys.path.append()` and external WebScraping imports
- **Full Pipeline Runner**: Removed parent directory path manipulation
- **Setup Models**: Changed from external E module directory to local `models/` directory
- **Simple Predict**: Updated checkpoint paths to use local `models/` structure
- **Emotion Analyzer**: Already using local models directory
- **External Files**: Removed `create_model_archive.py` (no longer needed)

#### Verification of Self-Containment
✅ **Zero External Dependencies**: No imports from parent directories
✅ **Complete Functionality**: All modules use local implementations
✅ **Clean Structure**: All paths point to internal project structure
✅ **Model Isolation**: Models stored in local `models/` directory
✅ **No sys.path Manipulation**: All imports use relative or local paths

#### Final Directory Structure (Self-Contained)
```

```

#### Impact
- **Portability**: Pipeline can be copied anywhere and run independently
- **Distribution**: Single folder contains everything needed
- **Maintenance**: No external dependency tracking required
- **Reliability**: No risk of external modules changing or disappearing

### Recent Improvements (January 6, 2025 - Session 2)

#### Web Scraping Progress Bar Enhancement
**Problem**: Progress bars weren't showing in Jupyter notebooks during scraping
**Solutions Implemented**:
- Added `tqdm.notebook` import for Jupyter compatibility
- Added `sys.stdout.flush()` after all print statements for real-time output
- Enhanced progress bar to handle Steam API early termination gracefully
- Added automatic completion when Steam returns 0 reviews vs missing cursor

**Progress Bar Fixes**:
- Red progress bar issue: Steam's `total_reviews` estimate often exceeds actual available reviews
- Solution: Auto-adjust progress bar total when API ends early
- Added completion messages for different exit conditions
- Commented out debug print statements for cleaner output

#### Model Setup Directory Structure Fix
**Problem**: Downloaded models extracted to `models/model_distribution/` but expected in `models/`
**Solution**: Added automatic directory restructuring in setup script
- Detects existing `model_distribution` folder
- Moves all model directories up one level
- Removes empty distribution folder
- Provides clear status messages

#### Web Scraping Performance Analysis
**Insights from Real Usage**:
- Baldur's Gate 3: ~500k-600k reviews (12-15 hours to scrape)
- Language detection on every review is the primary bottleneck
- Steam's pagination system uses cursor tokens (not repeated pages)
- Steam API estimates are often inaccurate (10854 estimated vs 10122 actual)
- Filtering rate: ~15% of reviews removed by language/content filtering

#### Text Cleaning Validation
**Confirmed Expected Behavior**:
- Input: "Absolutely adore the story behind this game!"
- Output: "absolut ador stori behind game get move second one"
- Removes punctuation, numbers, special characters
- Converts to lowercase, standardizes spacing
- Required for ML model compatibility

#### Jupyter Notebook Structure Fixes
- Added missing "## Step 2: Web Scraping" header
- Corrected cell numbering and organization
- Enhanced progress descriptions for user clarity
- Added real-time progress information to step descriptions

### Technical Debt Addressed
- ✅ **Real-time Progress**: Fixed buffered output in Jupyter notebooks
- ✅ **Model Directory**: Automated proper model installation structure  
- ✅ **Progress Bar Colors**: Fixed red bars from incomplete Steam estimates
- ✅ **Debug Cleanup**: Commented out verbose debugging for production use
- ✅ **Documentation**: Added notebook headers and clear step descriptions

### Performance Optimizations Identified
1. **Language Detection**: Most expensive operation, could be optimized
2. **DataFrame Operations**: Row-by-row addition is inefficient
3. **Steam API**: No rate limiting could cause throttling
4. **Memory Usage**: Large games require streaming approach

### Testing Completed
- **Small Games**: A Short Hike (~3k reviews), Coffee Talk (~2k reviews)
- **Medium Games**: Unpacking (~8k reviews), Pizza Tower (~5k reviews)
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates working correctly
- **Model Installation**: Automatic directory fixing verified
- **Directory Structure**: Clean overwrite system functioning

### Recent Updates (January 6, 2025 - Session 3): Major Performance & Architecture Improvements

#### Multi-way JSD Implementation Completed
**Problem Identified**: Original emotion analysis used fake "entropy" calculation
- **Issue**: `entropy = 1 - confidence` was just a mathematical transformation, not real uncertainty
- **Evidence**: Perfect correlation (-0.984) showed it was deterministic, not model behavior
- **Impact**: Misleading uncertainty analysis that didn't represent actual model disagreement

**Solution Implemented**: Multi-way Jensen-Shannon Divergence
- **Real Model Disagreement**: `JSD(P1, P2, P3) = (1/3) * [KL(P1||M) + KL(P2||M) + KL(P3||M)]`
- **Scientific Foundation**: Proper information-theoretic measure of model uncertainty
- **Meaningful Interpretation**: 
  - Low JSD = Models agree (high ensemble confidence)
  - High JSD = Models disagree (uncertainty about true emotion)

#### Major Performance Optimizations for GPU Utilization
**Problem**: Low GPU utilization on high-end hardware (RTX 4090)
- **Root Cause**: Processing texts one-by-one instead of true batching
- **Impact**: ~916 individual GPU calls × 3 models = 2748 separate operations

**Solution**: True Batch Processing Architecture
- **New `predict_batch()` method**: Processes entire batches at GPU level
- **Batch tokenization**: `padding=True` instead of `padding='max_length'`
- **Increased batch size**: 16 → 32 (optimized for RTX 4090)
- **Eliminated redundant loops**: Batch operations at model level
- **Performance gain**: 5-10x faster emotion analysis
- **GPU utilization**: Dramatically improved from low to high usage

#### Emotion Analysis Architecture Overhaul
**Previous Inefficiencies**:
- Ensemble predictions: `use_ensemble=True` 
- Individual predictions: `use_ensemble=False`
- Disagreement analysis: Additional 100-sample run (redundant!)

**New Efficient Architecture**:
- **Single prediction run**: `predict_batch()` gets all data in one pass
- **Eliminated redundant sampling**: Use full dataset for disagreement analysis
- **Removed `ensemble_only` parameter**: Always get complete individual model data
- **Batch ensemble calculation**: Compute ensemble from batch individual results
- **Removed typing imports**: Simplified code complexity
- **Performance gain**: ~3x faster overall (1 prediction run vs 3)

#### ABSA Confidence Distribution Added
**User Request**: "Shouldn't there be a confidence distribution chart then?"
**Implementation**: Added ABSA confidence visualization showing:
- Histogram of all sentiment confidence scores (before 60% filtering)
- Red threshold line at 60% confidence cutoff
- Statistics showing total predictions vs. included predictions
- Explanation for discrepancy: 730 aspects detected → 728 high-confidence predictions

#### Visualization Improvements & Simplification
**Problem**: Overly complex, cluttered visualizations with meaningless dimensions

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Removed useless "Review Index" scatter plots**: No insight value
- **Eliminated point size complexity**: Review length showed no correlation with disagreement
- **Clean 2x1 + 1 large layout**: Compact summaries + focused main analysis
- **Individual emotion trend lines**: Each emotion gets own trend line (alpha=0.5)
- **Removed review length analysis**: All categories had similar averages
- **Focused on meaningful relationships**: Confidence vs Disagreement by Emotion

#### Technical Debt Resolved
- ✅ **GPU Batch Processing**: True batching instead of individual text processing
- ✅ **Array Boolean Evaluation**: Fixed numpy array ambiguity errors with safer validation
- ✅ **Prediction Efficiency**: Eliminated redundant prediction calls (3x → 1x)
- ✅ **Real Uncertainty**: Replaced fake entropy with proper Jensen-Shannon Divergence
- ✅ **Code Simplification**: Removed unnecessary typing complexity and parameters
- ✅ **Visualization Clarity**: Removed clutter, focused on actionable insights
- ✅ **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized tokenization and batch operations

### Performance Metrics Achieved
- **GPU Utilization**: Dramatically improved on high-end hardware (RTX 4090)
- **Emotion Analysis Speed**: 5-10x faster with true batch processing
- **Pipeline Efficiency**: 3x reduction in redundant prediction calls
- **Batch Size**: Optimized to 32 for modern GPU memory
- **Model Disagreement**: Now calculated on full dataset instead of 100-sample

### Architecture Decisions Finalized
- **Batch-First Design**: All prediction operations use batch processing
- **Single-Pass Predictions**: Individual + ensemble results from one call
- **Real Uncertainty Metrics**: Jensen-Shannon Divergence for model disagreement
- **Clean Visualizations**: Focused on actionable insights, removed clutter
- **Hardware Optimization**: Designed for modern GPU capabilities

### Open Questions
- Memory requirements for full pipeline on large datasets (>10k reviews)
- Further GPU optimization opportunities for even larger batch sizes
- Steam API rate limiting best practices for very large games (>100k reviews)
